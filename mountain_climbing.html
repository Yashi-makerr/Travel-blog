          <p>Mountaineering, or mountain climbing, is the sport of reaching, or trying to reach, high points in mountainous areas, mainly for the joy and thrill of the climb. The sport involves intense physical activity. It includes hiking, rock climbing, and traversing slopes covered with ice and snow. Climbers test their skills, strength, balance, resourcefulness, courage, and endurance as they master hazardous conditions and difficult terrain. Many also gain satisfaction from experiencing the grandeur of nature. </p>

It rises to 12,388 feet (3,776 metres) near the Pacific Ocean coast in Yamanashi and Shizuoka ken (prefectures) of central Honshu, about 60 miles (100 km) west of the Tokyo-Yokohama metropolitan area. It is a volcano that has been dormant since its last eruption, in 1707, but is still generally classified as active by geologists. The mountain is the major feature of Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park (1936), and it is at the centre of a UNESCO World Heritage site designated in 2013.

Ama Dablam means "mother's necklace"; the long ridges on each side like the arms of a mother (ama) protecting her child, and the hanging glacier thought of as the dablam, the traditional double-pendant containing pictures of the gods, worn by Sherpa women.[3] For several days, Ama Dablam dominates the eastern sky for anyone trekking to Mount Everest Base Camp. For its soaring ridges and steep faces Ama Dablam is sometimes referred as the "Matterhorn of the Himalayas."[4] The mountain is featured on the one rupee Nepalese banknote</p>

Allermuir Hill provides superb views of the capital whilst further into the range there is wonderful ridge-walking along Carnethy Hill, Scald Law and the Kips.

                  North of the Pentlands is West Lothian. At first glance the attractions of walking here as less obvious, but there are many hidden gems. The coastline of the Firth of Forth provides some fine routes, often with views of the iconic Forth Rail Bridge, whilst inland the attractions range from historic Linlithgow Palace to country parks such as Beecraigs, Almondell and Calderwood.</p>

                <p>Gasherbrum is a remote group of peaks situated at the northeastern end of the Baltoro Glacier in the Karakoram mountain range. The peaks are located within the border region of Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan and Xinjiang, China. The massif contains three of the world's 8,000 metre peaks (if Broad Peak is included). The highly visible face of Gasherbrum IV has gained the nickname the "Shining Wall" and this has often been claimed as the meaning of the word "Gasherbrum". [1] However the name Gasherbrum comes from "rgasha" (beautiful) + "brum" (mountain) in Balti, hence it actually means "beautiful mountain".[2]

                <p>Rising 7,707 meters above sea level, Tirich Mir is the highest mountain located in the Hindu Kush mountain range. It is situated in Chitral, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.

                  In 1950, a Norwegian expedition team first scaled the peak, which overlooks Chitral. You can get beautiful glimpses of the peak from Chitral’s main market.
                  
                  Tirich Mir gets its name from the village Tirich where the peak is located. The Khowar speaking people of the village are highly hospitable and always available to lend you a helping hand in your expedition endeavor.
                  
                  The route to Tirich Mir is very risky, providing an opportunity for extreme adventure lovers to put their dexterity and passion to the test. Some local legends suggest that Tirich Mir is a kingdom of Djinns, fairies, wizards and witches who wouldn’t let human beings into their area.</p>
