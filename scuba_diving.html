                    <p>Late in the 19th century, the focus began to shift from collecting and cataloging to the systematic analysis of marine ecosystems and the ecological roles and behaviour of marine life. By the early 20th century, oceanographers had begun to intensively study fishing grounds and other localities of economic importance. This research combined studies of marine flora and fauna, ocean currents, water temperature, salinity, and oxygen levels, and other factors in an effort to understand the relationship between marine animals and their environment.</p>

                    <p>Sharm El Sheikh is home to some fantastic local diving as well as some impressive shipwrecks, walls and reefs offering around 30 different sites to explore on day trips alone. The boats are large, comfortable and designed specifically for diving. Ras Mohammed National Park offers a number of exciting sites for those on day diving trips. One of Ras Mohammed's most popular dive sites is Shark and Yolanda Reef, where divers can encounter schools of hammerhead sharks, whitetip reef sharks, and barracuda. This site is also home to the remains of the Yolanda, a cargo ship that sank in 1980 and left behind a treasure trove of cargo, including toilets, bathtubs, and even BMWs!

                    <p> In 2018, after scuba diving on Havelock Island (India) for the first time in my life, I felt a deep connection with the ocean. It had casted its spell, and to date, it is holding me in its net of wonder. Life under the water is magical, and I have decided to explore it as much as possible. While preparing for my vacation in the Middle East, it was obvious for me to include Oman because of Daymaniyat Islands, which are popular for their rich marine life. Scuba diving there was the highlight of my trip</p>

                    <p>In 2011, their government banned all commercial shark fishing, allowing sharks in the Bahamas to roam freely. Apart from shark diving, the diverse range of diving in the Bahamas includes blue holes and caves, historical wrecks and lush reefs, and dynamic walls.

                      The Bahamas also offers unmatched visibility and a wide range of diving opportunities for divers of any level, which, all in all, make the Bahamas a strong contender for those seeking the best diving in the Caribbean.

                    <p>Trinidad and Tobago offers many experiences for the discerning scuba diver. Just north of Venezuela and south of Grenada, this modest island is home to just over 50,000 people. But, its small size belies its reputation for big diving.

                      With dive sites for every experience level, healthy reefs feature hard and soft coral and provide the chance to view some of the largest recorded brain coral in the world. Most dives are thrilling drifts fuelled by the nutrient-rich Guyana Current and offer the opportunity to swim with pelagics â€“ a treat for even the most experienced diver.
