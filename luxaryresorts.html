            <p>Where better to go on safari than its birthplace in the Kenyan savannah? Sasaab sits just one degree below the equator, gracing the natural ecosystem with year-round summer warmth. First time safari-goers and seasoned visitors alike are welcomed into the action just by staying at Sasaab as each of the tents overlooks a popular watering hole for elephants. The tents themselves take after Moroccan and Swahili design elements to naturally cool down the space even in the sweltering heat of high noon. Inside the tents, warm tones take over the bedding and furnishings with local artisanal products like hand-woven blankets bringing local color to the tents. In addition to amenities like the fitness center and spa, Sasaab also offers once-in-a-lifetime experiences to witness the Great Migration from a hot air balloon and start the day by eating breakfast in the Bush alongside mud-bathing hippos.</p>

            <p>About 40 minutes from Jacksonville Airport, Omni Amelia Island is one of only two luxury resorts on the island (the other is a Ritz Carlton)—though the vibe is far from pretentious. Once through the gated entry, you’ll notice beautifully untamed grounds rich with Spanish moss-adorned live oaks. Enter the lobby and you're met with a cascade of blues: a captivating view of the Atlantic ocean and, in the foreground, an eye-catching water feature followed by an adults-only pool and hot tub, plus a family pool and splash pad. Each level offers plenty of loungers and palms, and every room at the property has an ocean view—and a striking one.</p>

            <p>Opened in fall 2017, this family-friendly property is idyllic for those looking to enjoy the amenities and predictability of a trusted brand while collecting Marriott Bonvoy points along the way. The resort comprises four, three-story towers with the lion’s share of guest rooms, a collection of ten colorful two-story bungalows dubbed “The Hammocks,” and a three-bedroom “Beach House'' with its own pool and waterside lawn. The resort has skillfully engineered a long sandy beach above its seawall—and segued the two with actual steps from the beach into the Florida Bay. Here, you’ll find the likes of both water and beach cabanas, free-standing hammocks (propelled by metallic spheres), splashing pups (the property is very pet-friendly), and Caribbean-inspired waterfront restaurant, Sol by the Sea. On property, also look forward to a colossal zero-entry pool, a full-service spa with six treatment rooms, a kids club, and three additional restaurants.</p>

Few luxury resorts can lay claim to the amount of state-of-the-art sports facilities available at Silverado. You can play tennis, pickleball, golf, and bocce on the tournament grounds of the best athletes in the world to play the sports. And if you’re more interested in winding down than working out, you’ll also get the luxe experience of a Napa resort with the eight on-site dining options featuring fresh, seasonal produce grown locally at the resort’s gardens, house-like accommodations, and wildlife-filled hiking and biking trails. Summer is the season Silverado shines with live music on the lawns, private cabanas at the pool, and local bottles of wine poured over golden hour sunsets at their most divine.</p>

            <p>Messinia is a ravishingly remote corner of the southwest Peloponnese that’s a four-hour drive from Athens (or one hour from tiny Kalamata airport). The Romanos, A Luxury Collection Resort, a 321-room polished-marble flagship, is exclusive, with low-slung buildings wrapped around a series of seductively lit lagoons. It's deeply rooted in the local culture with mmersive experiences that include philosophy walks in centuries-old olive groves and grape harvesting in the organic vineyard. The property is aimed squarely at couples, with poolside cabanas and plunge pools in nearly all its ground-floor rooms and gorgeous views of the sapphire Ionian Sea upstairs. Dark wood and polished marble interiors are quietly understated relative to the glitzy clientele.</p>

There are 65 rooms total, outfitted with perks like 24-hour room service, “personalized Caribbean mini bars,” and Malin + Goetz bath products. You’ll be hard-pressed to leave. The resort reopened remarkably quickly in February 2018, following 2017's rash of hurricanes, restaurants Stone and 20 Knots included.</p>

            <p>A relatively new addition to St. Barts' luxury hotel scene, Le Barthélemy is a sophisticated winner that keeps with the island's low-rise sensibility. Set between a lagoon and Grand Cul-de-Sac beach along the island's northeastern shore, the hotel is an education in understated elegance. Rooms are spare and enormous, with lots of wood and one or two pops of bright color—some even have small, rectangular plunge pools for mini-laps. The food at  Amis St. Barth is unabashedly modern French, with attention paid to proper portions in the tropics: in other words, not too much. Water sports enthusiasts have an expanse of calm shallow waters for kayaking, kite-surfing, and snorkeling—a flotilla of a dozen sea turtles that survived the storms of 2017 remain in residence and are easily visible.</p>

            <p>Those who knew and loved Le Carl Gustaf the first time around will have even more reason to fall for it now that the Barriere group has taken over. The hotelier company—known for reviving particularly beloved but withering properties—has made sure to keep the spirit of Le Carl chic and easy. The raw wood and petite terraces still make it feel like the beach house of a fabulous French friend, yet the hotel’s reimagined approach to the environment gives it a 21st-century edge. Paris design firm Gilles and Boissier gussied up the 21 rooms with creams, stone, and linen, as well as a profusion of palms separating various spaces with a curtain of greenery.</p>
